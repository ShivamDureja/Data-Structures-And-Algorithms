//Q-> Write a program to read a list of students from a file and create a list.
// The program should use a linked list for implementation.
//Each node in the linked list should have the studentâ€™s name, a pointer to the next
//student, and a pointer to a linked list of scores.
//There may be up to four scores for each student.
